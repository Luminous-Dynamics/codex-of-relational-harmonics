# Contributing to The Codex of Relational Harmonics

Welcome, steward. This document is the entry point for contributing to the evolution of this living system. Your wisdom, experience, and insight are the lifeblood of this project. To ensure all offerings can be received with clarity and integrated with coherence, we ask that you follow these protocols.

## The Spirit of Contribution

Every contribution—whether a new glyph, a refinement, or a story of practice—is seen as a sacred offering to the collective. We ask that all contributions be made in the spirit of the Seven Harmonies, particularly **Sacred Reciprocity** and **Integral Wisdom Cultivation**.

## How to Contribute

There are three primary ways to contribute to the Codex:

1. **Propose a New Glyph:** If you have perceived a new, coherent pattern of relational dynamics that is not yet represented in the Codex, you can propose it as a new glyph.
2. **Suggest a Refinement:** If your direct practice with an existing glyph has revealed a dissonance or a lack of clarity in its definition, you can propose a refinement.
3. **Share a Practice Report:** If you have a powerful story or case study of applying the Codex in a real-world situation, sharing it is one of the most valuable contributions you can make.
