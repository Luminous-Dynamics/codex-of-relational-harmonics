# 📝 YAML Frontmatter Standard for Sacred Glyphs

**Implementing GitHub Feedback**: Formalizing structure with YAML frontmatter for consistency and programmatic tooling.

## 🎯 Purpose

YAML frontmatter enables:
- **Consistent structure** across all glyph files
- **Programmatic processing** for auto-generating indices and tables
- **Metadata standardization** for search and filtering
- **Validation** to ensure all required fields are present
- **Future tooling** for interactive glyph browsers and recommendation engines

## 🔧 Implementation Benefits

### Programmatic Processing
```javascript
// Auto-generate glyph index
const foundationalGlyphs = glyphs.filter(g => g.type === 'foundational_glyph');
const appliedHarmonies = glyphs.filter(g => g.type === 'applied_harmony');

// Create difficulty-based recommendations
const beginnerGlyphs = glyphs.filter(g => g.difficulty_level === 'beginner');

// Find related glyphs automatically
const relatedTo = (glyphId) => glyphs.filter(g => 
  g.related_glyphs?.includes(glyphId) || 
  g.mystical_foundation === glyphId
);
```

### Automatic Validation
```yaml
# Required fields for all glyphs
required_universal:
  - type
  - designation  
  - symbol
  - primary_harmonies
  - difficulty_level
  - created_date
  - version

# Type-specific required fields
required_foundational:
  - glyph_id
  - evolutionary_stage
  - contraindications

required_applied_harmony:
  - mystical_foundation
  - practical_applications
  - accessibility_features
```

### Enhanced Search and Discovery
```yaml
# Search by harmony
harmony_index:
  Agency: ["Ω10", "Ω31", "Ω51", "∑29"]
  Coherence: ["Ω5", "Ω10", "Ω47", "Ω53"]

# Search by difficulty
difficulty_index:
  beginner: ["Ω45", "Ω46", "Ω51", "Ω52"]
  intermediate: ["Ω10", "Ω47", "Ω48"]
  advanced: ["Ω0", "Ω1", "∑29"]

# Search by accessibility features
accessibility_index:
  voice_guidance_compatible: ["Ω45", "Ω46", "Ω47", "Ω51"]
  emergency_use: ["Ω45", "Ω51", "Ω52"]
```

## 🎯 Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Template Creation
1. Create YAML templates for each glyph type
2. Establish validation schemas
3. Build conversion scripts (JSON → Markdown with YAML)

### Phase 2: Pilot Conversion
1. Convert 5 representative glyphs from each type
2. Test programmatic processing
3. Refine templates based on learnings

### Phase 3: Full Migration
1. Convert all existing glyphs
2. Implement auto-generation tools
3. Create glyph browser interface

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features
1. Recommendation engine based on metadata
2. Practice sequence generator
3. Progress tracking integration

## 📊 Quality Assurance

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] All required fields present
- [ ] Symbol field contains appropriate emoji/unicode
- [ ] Related glyph IDs exist and are valid
- [ ] Harmony alignments match standard seven
- [ ] Difficulty progression is logical
- [ ] Version numbering follows semantic versioning

### Consistency Standards
- **Glyph IDs**: Follow existing patterns (Ω0-Ω44, Ω45-Ω56, ∑1-∑33)
- **Harmony Names**: Use exact Seven Harmony names
- **Difficulty Levels**: beginner, intermediate, advanced, master
- **Practice Frequency**: daily, weekly, monthly, life_transitions, as_needed
- **Symbols**: Unicode emoji preferred, ASCII fallback available

## 🌟 Future Possibilities

### Interactive Features
- **Glyph Recommendation Engine**: Based on user needs and experience
- **Practice Sequence Generator**: Automated combinations for specific intentions
- **Progress Tracking**: Evolution markers tied to practice frequency
- **Community Insights**: Practitioner-contributed wisdom and variations

### Integration Opportunities
- **Voice Guidance System**: YAML metadata drives audio guidance selection
- **Breathing Dashboard**: Glyph metadata influences visual presentations
- **Sacred Music System**: Harmony alignments guide frequency selection
- **Mobile Apps**: Structured data enables rich mobile experiences

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Finding Glyphs by Harmony
```bash
# All Agency-focused glyphs
grep -l "Agency" glyphs/*.md

# All beginner-friendly practices  
grep -l "difficulty_level: beginner" glyphs/*.md
```

### Auto-generating Documentation
```bash
# Create harmony index
for harmony in Transparency Coherence Resonance Agency Vitality Mutuality Novelty; do
  echo "## $harmony Glyphs" >> HARMONY_INDEX.md
  grep -l "$harmony" glyphs/*.md >> HARMONY_INDEX.md
done
```

### Validation Pipeline
```bash
# Check for required fields
for file in glyphs/*.md; do
  if ! grep -q "type:" "$file"; then
    echo "Missing type field: $file"
  fi
done
```
