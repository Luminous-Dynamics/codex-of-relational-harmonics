# Quickstart: Begin Practicing in 5 Minutes
*The fastest path to experiencing conscious relationship*

## Your First Practice: Ω0 (First Presence)

**Right now, before reading further:**

1. **Pause** and take three conscious breaths
2. **Notice** your body touching the chair/floor
3. **Ask** yourself: "What is actually here right now?"
4. **Rest** in this awareness for 30 seconds

Congratulations - you just practiced your first glyph.

## What Just Happened?

You activated **Ω0 - First Presence**, the foundation of all conscious relationship. This simple practice:
- Brings you into the present moment
- Connects you with your body and breath  
- Creates space for wisdom to emerge
- Establishes the ground for authentic connection

## The Three Essential Practices

To get started immediately, focus on these three foundational glyphs:

### **Ω0 - First Presence** (Just practiced above)
**Use when**: You feel scattered, reactive, or disconnected
**Practice**: Return to breath and body awareness
**Integration**: Use as a "reset button" throughout your day

### **Ω15 - Sacred Pause**
**Use when**: You feel triggered or want to react impulsively  
**Practice**: 
1. Notice the urge to react
2. Take one conscious breath
3. Ask: "What does this situation need from me?"
4. Respond from wisdom rather than reactivity

### **Ω1 - Root Chord of Covenant**
**Use when**: Beginning important conversations
**Practice**:
1. Make eye contact with the other person
2. Take one breath together  
3. Say: "I'm here to connect consciously with you"
4. Listen to their response without planning your reply

## Your 7-Day Quick Practice

**Day 1-2**: Practice Ω0 three times daily (morning, midday, evening)
**Day 3-4**: Add Ω15 whenever you feel reactive
**Day 5-7**: Begin conversations with Ω1

## The Essential Mindset

As you begin:

- **Stay gentle**: Self-compassion accelerates growth
- **Trust the process**: Changes often happen gradually

## Remember

The goal isn't to memorize techniques but to embody love more fully. These glyphs are invitations to return to what you already know in your deepest wisdom.

**Every moment of conscious presence matters.**
