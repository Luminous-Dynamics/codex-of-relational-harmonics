## 🌱 Community Guidelines

### Sacred Communication Principles
1. **Presence First**: Arrive present before posting (practice Ω45)

3. **Conscious Speech**: Share from wisdom, not reactivity
4. **Mutual Respect**: Honor all paths and perspectives
5. **Growth Orientation**: Transform challenges into learning

### Practical Guidelines
- Use the discussion templates to structure your posts
- Check existing discussions before creating duplicates
- Mark glyphs mentioned with their numbers (e.g., Ω45, ∑12)
- Share experiences, not prescriptions
- Maintain confidentiality when sharing others' stories
