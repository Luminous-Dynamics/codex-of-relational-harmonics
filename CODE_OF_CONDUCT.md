## Accountability Process

When someone's behavior harms the community field, we respond with **restorative rather than punitive justice**.

### Step 1: Direct Communication
When safe and appropriate, we encourage direct, compassionate communication between those involved, using NVC principles and ERC practices.

### Step 2: Mediated Dialogue
If direct communication isn't effective, community stewards can facilitate dialogue using restorative circle processes.

### Step 3: Community Response
For severe violations or patterns of harm, the response may include:
- Temporary suspension from community spaces
- Required learning and practice before returning
- Ongoing accountability partnership
- In extreme cases, permanent exclusion

### Crisis Response
For immediate safety concerns (threats of violence, doxxing, etc.), we will:
- Remove the person immediately from community spaces
- Report to appropriate authorities if necessary
- Provide support to those harmed
- Address the incident transparently with the community

## Cultural Considerations

### Acknowledging Privilege
We recognize that dominant cultural patterns (white supremacy, patriarchy, capitalism, etc.) exist within us and our community. We commit to:
- Ongoing education about systemic oppression
- Centering voices of those most marginalized
- Examining how power dynamics affect our interactions
- Creating specific support for underrepresented participants

### Trauma Awareness
Many people come to this work carrying trauma. We commit to:
- Creating as much safety as possible in community spaces
- Recognizing that triggers can arise unpredictably
- Having resources available for crisis support
- Understanding that healing isn't linear or predictable

### Accessibility
We strive to make our community accessible to people with different abilities by:
- Providing multiple ways to participate and contribute
- Using plain language whenever possible
- Offering sliding scale or free options for financial barriers
- Adapting our practices for different physical and cognitive needs
