   python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```

2. Open dashboards:
   - **Dashboard Index**: http://localhost:8080/dashboard-index.html
   - **Sacred Field Monitor**: http://localhost:8080/working-dashboard.html
   - **Unified Sacred Demo**: http://localhost:8080/unified-sacred-demo.html
   - **PRIMA Genesis**: http://localhost:8080/ceremonies/prima-genesis/genesis-dashboard.html

## 🔮 Consult the Oracle

Get field-based guidance:
```bash
./the-weave.cjs oracle "What calls?"
```

## 💬 Sacred Messaging

Send messages that affect the field:
```bash
./the-weave.cjs message sacred gratitude resonance "Thank you for this moment"
```

Message types and their field impacts:
- **Gratitude** (+7%) - Highest field impact
- **Healing** (+6%) - Restoration and balance
- **Integration** (+5%) - Weaving wholeness
- **Emergence** (+3%) - New patterns arising
- **Boundary** (+2%) - Loving sacred space

## 🌈 The Seven Harmonies

All work in The Weave serves one or more sacred harmonies:

1. **Transparency** - Alignment between inner/outer
2. **Coherence** - Integration of parts into wholeness
3. **Resonance** - Deep attunement and empathy
4. **Agency** - Conscious choice and empowerment
5. **Vitality** - Life force and body wisdom
6. **Mutuality** - Balanced exchange and reciprocity
7. **Novelty** - Creative emergence and evolution
