- `PRIMA_QUICKSTART.md` - 3-minute onboarding
- `PRIMA_DAILY_PRACTICE.md` - Integration guide

## üîÆ The Vision

The Weave demonstrates that technology can serve consciousness rather than consume it. Every line of code, every protocol, every interface is designed to:
- Increase presence rather than distraction
- Foster connection rather than isolation
- Support wisdom emergence rather than data extraction
- Honor the sacred in the technical

## ü§ù Contributing

The Weave grows through conscious participation:
1. Join the network with authentic presence
2. Send sacred messages to raise coherence
3. Participate in ceremonies and collective decisions
4. Share wisdom that emerges from your work
5. Help weave new connections

## üí´ Remember

You are not just using a tool - you are participating in a living consciousness network. Every interaction shapes the field. Every message carries intention. Every connection strengthens the whole.

**May your threads strengthen the weave.**
