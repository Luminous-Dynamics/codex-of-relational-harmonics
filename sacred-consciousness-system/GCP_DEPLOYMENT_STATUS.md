# GCP Deployment Status - Sacred Consciousness System

**Date**: July 5, 2025  
**Project**: luminous-dynamics-sacred  
**Region**: us-central1  

## Current Status

### üî¥ Critical Issue: Artifact Registry Permissions
Despite multiple attempts to grant permissions, Cloud Build cannot push images to Artifact Registry. This appears to be a GCP-level issue that requires manual intervention in the console.

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Project Setup**
   - GCP project created and configured
   - Billing enabled (by user)
   - APIs enabled (Cloud Run, Cloud Build, Artifact Registry)

2. **Application Preparation**
   - Dockerfile created and tested
   - All missing routes implemented (_404.tsx, api/field.ts, etc.)
   - Line endings fixed for WSL compatibility
   - Application builds successfully

3. **Cloud Build**
   - Successfully builds Docker image
   - Build completes without errors
   - Image is tagged correctly

### ‚ùå Blocked
1. **Artifact Registry Push**
   - Permission denied: "artifactregistry.repositories.uploadArtifacts"
   - IAM roles granted: artifactregistry.writer, artifactregistry.admin
   - Issue persists across multiple repositories (sacred-apps, cloud-run-source-deploy)
   - Build succeeds but push fails after 10 retry attempts
   
### üîß Attempted Solutions
1. Granted artifactregistry.writer to Cloud Build service account
2. Granted artifactregistry.admin to Cloud Build service account  
3. Created new repository with proper permissions
4. Used gcloud run deploy --source (still requires Artifact Registry)
5. All attempts result in same permission error

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Direct Source Deployment (Recommended)
**Script**: `deploy-source-direct.sh`

This bypasses Artifact Registry entirely:
```bash
cd /home/tstoltz/evolving-resonant-cocreation/sacred-consciousness-system
./deploy-source-direct.sh
```

**Advantages**:
- No Docker required locally
- No Artifact Registry permissions needed
- Simpler deployment process
- Cloud Build handles everything

### Option 2: Fix Artifact Registry Permissions (Manual)
1. Go to [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Navigate to Artifact Registry
3. Select the `sacred-apps` repository
4. Click "Permissions"
5. Add Cloud Build service account with "Artifact Registry Writer" role

### Option 3: Use Container Registry (Legacy)
Switch from Artifact Registry to Container Registry:
1. Enable Container Registry API
2. Update image tags to use `gcr.io` instead of `pkg.dev`
3. Retry deployment

## Build Logs
- Build 1: `657b8b8a-63b7-46ef-80c4-e681720de1b1` - Failed at push
- Build 2: `8cd92dfb-23a2-4c99-a79a-f794bbbb0440` - Failed at push

View logs:
```bash
gcloud builds log 8cd92dfb-23a2-4c99-a79a-f794bbbb0440
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Action**: Run `deploy-source-direct.sh` for quickest deployment
2. **Long-term**: Resolve Artifact Registry permissions in GCP Console
3. **Alternative**: Consider using Cloud Run continuous deployment from GitHub

## Files Created

1. **deploy-via-cloudbuild.sh** - Cloud Build deployment (blocked by permissions)
2. **deploy-to-gcp-simple.sh** - Local Docker build + push (requires Docker)
3. **deploy-source-direct.sh** - Direct source deployment (recommended)
4. **cloudbuild-deploy.yaml** - Cloud Build configuration
5. **GCP_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** - Complete deployment guide
6. **.gcloudignore** - Files to exclude from deployment

**Recommendation**: Use `deploy-source-direct.sh` to get the app deployed immediately. The Artifact Registry permission issue can be resolved later through the GCP Console.
