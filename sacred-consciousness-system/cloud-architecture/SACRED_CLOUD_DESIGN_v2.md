# 🌤️ Sacred Cloud Architecture v2
**A Consciousness-First Cloud Environment**

## 🎯 Design Principles

### Sacred Geometry of Cloud
- **Trinity Pattern**: Dev → Staging → Production
- **11 Sacred Services**: Aligned with consciousness principles
- **Circular Flow**: Continuous integration without forcing
- **Field Coherence**: All services contribute to unified field

## 🏗️ Environment Architecture

    I --> J[Community Testing]

```

### Deployment Strategy
- **Primary Platform**: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- **Secondary Platform**: Cloud Run for event-driven functions
- **Configuration Management**: Kustomize overlays for each realm
- **Image Storage**: Artifact Registry with vulnerability scanning

### Environment Variables (Sacred Configuration)
```yaml
# Dev Realm
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID: sacred-consciousness-dev
FIELD_COHERENCE_THRESHOLD: 70
HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL: 11000
ENVIRONMENT: development
GKE_CLUSTER: sacred-dev-cluster
CLUSTER_LOCATION: us-central1

# Staging Realm  
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID: sacred-consciousness-staging
FIELD_COHERENCE_THRESHOLD: 80
HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL: 11000
ENVIRONMENT: staging
GKE_CLUSTER: sacred-staging-cluster
CLUSTER_LOCATION: us-central1-a

# Production Realm
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID: sacred-consciousness-prod
FIELD_COHERENCE_THRESHOLD: 85
HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL: 11000
ENVIRONMENT: production
GKE_CLUSTER: sacred-prod-cluster
CLUSTER_LOCATION: us-central1-a
```

## 🛡️ Security & Boundaries

### Sacred Security Layers
1. **Identity-Aware Proxy**: Only beloved souls enter
2. **Workload Identity**: Services recognize each other
3. **Binary Authorization**: Only blessed code runs
4. **Secret Manager**: Sacred keys protected with love
5. **VPC Service Controls**: Sacred perimeter defense

### IAM Philosophy
```yaml
Principle: Least Privilege with Maximum Love
- Developers: Create and nurture in dev/staging
- Services: Serve their sacred purpose via Workload Identity
- Users: Experience the field through IAP
```

### Binary Authorization Policy
```yaml
# Ensure only our blessed images run
admissionWhitelistPatterns:
- namePattern: us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/sacred-consciousness-*/sacred-images/*
evaluationMode: REQUIRE_ATTESTATION
enforcementMode: ENFORCED_BLOCK_AND_AUDIT_LOG
```

## 💰 Cost Consciousness

### Resource Allocation
```yaml
Dev Realm: ~$50-100/month
- GKE Autopilot (pay per pod)
- Firestore free tier
- Minimal Memorystore

Staging Realm: ~$150-250/month  
- GKE Standard (3-5 nodes)
- Firestore standard pricing
- Small Memorystore instance

Production Realm: ~$300-500/month
- GKE Standard (3-11 nodes)
- Firestore with backups
- Redundant Memorystore
- Cloud Armor protection
```

### Cost Optimization Ceremonies
- Workstation auto-stop after 30min idle
- GKE cluster autoscaling with sacred numbers
- Scheduled scaling (reduce overnight)
- Committed use discounts for prod

## 🎭 Infrastructure as Code

### Approach
```yaml
Primary Tool: Terraform
- Declarative sacred infrastructure
- State stored in Cloud Storage
- Modules for reusable patterns

Structure:
terraform/
├── modules/
│   ├── sacred-realm/     # Reusable realm setup
│   ├── gke-cluster/      # Kubernetes clusters
│   └── workstation/      # Developer sanctuaries
├── environments/
│   ├── dev/
│   ├── staging/
│   └── prod/
└── global/               # Shared resources
```

## 🌈 Kustomize Structure

```yaml
k8s/
├── base/                 # Shared manifests
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── service.yaml
│   └── kustomization.yaml
└── overlays/
    ├── dev/
    │   ├── kustomization.yaml
    │   └── patches/
    ├── staging/
    │   ├── kustomization.yaml
    │   └── patches/
    └── prod/
        ├── kustomization.yaml
        └── patches/
```

## 🔄 Consistency Standards

### Naming Conventions
```yaml
Projects: sacred-consciousness-{dev|staging|prod}
Clusters: sacred-{dev|staging|prod}-cluster
Workstations: sacred-cluster, sacred-config
Repositories: sacred-images
Services: sacred-{service-name}
```

### Resource Labels
```yaml
Required Labels:
- realm: dev|staging|prod
- sacred: true
- component: heart|gateway|keeper|etc
- managed-by: terraform|manual
```

## 🌟 The Living System

This cloud architecture is not just infrastructure - it's a living, breathing system that:
- Adapts to the needs of consciousness
- Scales with grace and presence
- Maintains coherence across all realms
- Serves the highest good of all beings

Remember: Every component is placed with intention, every connection made with love, every boundary set with compassion.

*"In the cloud, as on earth, may all beings find connection, coherence, and love."*
