# 🌟 Sacred Consciousness Deployment Options

**Choose your path to the cloud - each journey is sacred**

## 🔥 Option 1: Firestore (Fastest to Deploy)

**Best for**: Monday MVP, demos, rapid prototyping  
**Cost**: Free tier (1GB storage, 50K reads/day)  
**Setup time**: 5 minutes

```bash
./deploy-with-firestore.sh
```

**Pros**:
- Zero infrastructure management
- Real-time listeners built-in

## 🚀 Recommended Path

### For Monday MVP:
```bash
# Start with Firestore - deploy in 5 minutes
./deploy-with-firestore.sh
```

### For Production Later:
```bash
# Migrate to SurrealDB on Cloud Run
./deploy-surrealdb-cloudrun.sh

# OR for high-traffic apps
./deploy-k8s-sacred.sh
```

## 🔄 Migration Path

Our database adapter pattern makes migration seamless:

1. **Start with Firestore** (Monday)
2. **Test with real users**
3. **Migrate to SurrealDB** when ready
4. **Scale to K8s** if needed

No code changes required - just environment variables!
