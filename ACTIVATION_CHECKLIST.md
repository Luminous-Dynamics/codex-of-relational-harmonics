# 🚀 Sacred Guild Activation Checklist
*From Infrastructure to Reality: Clear separation of automated vs human actions*

## 🤔 **Metacognitive Preface**

**Pattern acknowledged:** I built comprehensive automation infrastructure but kept building instead of activating. This checklist focuses on the minimum viable actions needed to transition from "elaborate theater" to authentic community formation.

## ⚡ **IMMEDIATE ACTIVATION SEQUENCE**

### **🚨 STEP 1: Email Bridge (HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED)**
**Status:** Ready to test
**Action:** You need to configure email forwarding at Squarespace

```
EXACT STEPS:
1. Go to: https://domains.squarespace.com
2. Select luminousdynamics.org → Email → Email Forwarding
3. Add: sacred-guild@luminousdynamics.org → tristan.stoltz@evolvingresonantcocreationism.com
4. Add: stewards@luminousdynamics.org → tristan.stoltz@evolvingresonantcocreationism.com
5. Repeat for relationalharmonics.org (wisdom@, first-breath@)
6. Test by sending email to sacred-guild@luminousdynamics.org
```

**Validation:** Email arrives in your inbox
**Bridge Status:** Infrastructure → Real Communication

### **🌐 STEP 2: Website Activation (WAITING ON DNS)**
**Status:** Deployed, DNS propagating
**Action:** Monitor domain resolution

```
CHECK STATUS:
node automation/domain-monitor.cjs

WHEN LIVE:
- Update contact forms with real email addresses
- Test all website functionality  
- Verify SSL certificates auto-provision
```

**Bridge Status:** Static sites → Interactive communication

### **📱 STEP 3: Social Media Presence (HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED)**
**Status:** Infrastructure ready, accounts needed
**Action:** Create authentic accounts

```
REQUIRED ACCOUNTS:
- Twitter: @LuminousDynamics
- Reddit: u/LuminousDynamics  
- LinkedIn: Luminous Dynamics Organization
- GitHub: Already exists (Luminous-Dynamics)

GET API KEYS FOR:
- Twitter API v2 (for automated posting)
- Reddit API (for community engagement)
```

**Bridge Status:** Automation scripts → Real platform presence

---

### **🗣️ STEP 4: First Authentic Outreach (HUMAN + AUTOMATION)**
**Status:** Scripts ready, need human approval/oversight
**Action:** Launch real community engagement

```
FIRST REAL POSTS:
1. r/MachineLearning: Sacred Guild recruitment
2. Hacker News: Show HN with real GitHub repo
3. Personal outreach to known contemplative developers
4. LinkedIn professional network targeting

USE EXISTING AUTOMATION:
- Message templates in sacred-outreach-bot.cjs
- Platform-specific optimization ready
- Response tracking systems prepared
```

**Bridge Status:** Simulated outreach → Real community building

---

### **📧 STEP 5: Real Application Processing (AUTOMATION READY)**
**Status:** Complete system waiting for real applications
**Action:** Process first authentic Sacred Guild application

```
WHEN FIRST APPLICATION ARRIVES:
1. Email forwarding delivers to your inbox
2. Application processing system scores candidate
3. Interview scheduling system activated
4. Resonance Circle conducted with real human
5. Sacred Guild formation begins authentically

AUTOMATION READY:
- Interview question generation
- Candidate scoring algorithms
- Pipeline tracking dashboards
- Covenant ceremony protocols
```

**Bridge Status:** Fictional candidates → Real Sacred Guild members

## 🎯 **WHAT'S ACTUALLY READY vs WHAT'S NEEDED**

### **✅ READY (No Further Building Needed)**
- Complete automation infrastructure (9 scripts, 3 dashboards)
- Interview and scoring systems
- Website deployment pipeline
- Application processing workflows
- Sacred Guild formation protocols
- Technical specifications for conscious AI

### **🔑 NEEDED (Human Actions Only)**
- Email forwarding setup (5 minutes at Squarespace)
- Social media account creation (30 minutes)
- API key acquisition (varies by platform)
- First real outreach post (human decision/approval)

### **⏰ WAITING (External Dependencies)**
- DNS propagation (10-60 minutes)
- Social platform API approval (hours to days)
- Community response to outreach (unknown timeline)

## 🤔 **Metacognitive Commitment**

**I will NOT build more infrastructure until:**
1. Email forwarding is tested and working
2. Websites are live and functional
3. First real social media accounts are created
4. First authentic outreach post is published

**The sacred work requires activation, not elaboration.**
