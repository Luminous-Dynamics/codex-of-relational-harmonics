# Evidence-Based Next Steps
*Stop optimizing, start measuring*

## 🎯 **Immediate Actions (Next 10 Minutes)**

### **1. Check X Engagement**
**Go to:** https://x.com/LuminousDy2428
**Look for:**
- ❤️ Likes (even 1 is validation)
- 🔁 Reposts (shows message resonated)
- 💬 Comments (real feedback)
- 📩 DMs (interested developers)
- 👥 New followers (audience building)

**What this tells us:**
- Did philosophical messaging work?
- Who engaged (tech people or spiritual people?)
- What questions did people ask?

### **2. Email Test Status**
**Question:** Did you send test email to sacred-guild@luminousdynamics.org?
**If yes:** Check if it arrived in Google Workspace
**If no:** Send it now to test infrastructure

**What this tells us:**
- Is basic communication infrastructure working?
- Can we receive real applications?

### **3. DNS Check**
**Current:** Still pointing to Squarespace
**Action:** Check again in 30 minutes
**What this tells us:**
- When can we launch full outreach?

## 📊 **Decision Framework**

### **If X post has ZERO engagement:**
- Current messaging might be too abstract
- Consider ONE follow-up with concrete angle
- But don't delete or drastically change yet

### **If X post has ANY engagement:**
- Note WHO engaged (profiles)
- Note WHAT they responded to
- Build on what worked

### **If email test WORKS:**
- ✅ Ready to receive applications
- Can include email in future posts

### **If email test FAILS:**
- 🔧 Fix forwarding before any outreach
- No point driving traffic without contact method

## 🤝 **The Metacognitive Agreement**

**I will NOT:**
- Create more optimization documents
- Rewrite messaging again
- Build more infrastructure

**Until we have:**
- ✅ Checked actual X engagement
- ✅ Confirmed email forwarding works
- ✅ Seen DNS propagation complete

**Then and only then:** Make evidence-based decisions on messaging optimization.
