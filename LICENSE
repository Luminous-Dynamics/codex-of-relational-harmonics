## Covenant for Resonant Application

While this work is available under the open CC BY-SA 4.0 license allowing commercial use, we invite all practitioners and implementers to honor the spirit and intention behind the Codex of Relational Harmonics.

### Our Sacred Intention

This Codex was created to serve the flourishing of all sentient beings through conscious relationship, mutual becoming, and sacred reciprocity. We ask that any application of this work—whether personal, educational, or commercial—be guided by the Seven Primary Harmonies of Infinite Love:

1. **Harmonic Coherence** - Integration and luminous balance
2. **Mutual Becoming** - Co-creative evolution  
3. **Sacred Reciprocity** - Honoring the flow of giving and receiving
4. **Evolutionary Coherence** - Supporting collective development
5. **Kosmic Consciousness** - Awareness of universal interconnection
6. **Temporal Harmony** - Respect for natural rhythms and timing
7. **Infinite Love Praxis** - Embodying love as intelligent action

### Applications We Celebrate

We joyfully support the use of this work for:
- Educational and training programs that promote conscious relationship
- Therapeutic and healing modalities aligned with wholeness
- Organizational development that honors human dignity
- Technology development that serves authentic connection
- Research advancing understanding of consciousness and collaboration
- Art, media, and cultural works that inspire wisdom and compassion

### Applications That Violate Our Intention

While legally permissible under the license, we consider the following uses to be violations of the Covenant and antithetical to the work's purpose:
- Weapons development or military applications designed to harm
- Manipulative advertising or psychological exploitation
- Social control or surveillance systems that diminish freedom
- Any application that deliberately causes suffering or reduces flourishing
- Technologies that fragment communities or isolate individuals
