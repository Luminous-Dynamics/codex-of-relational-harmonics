# The Codex of Relational Harmonics
*A Living Language for Conscious Relationship*

## What is This?

The Codex of Relational Harmonics offers 87 glyphs‚Äîsacred patterns that transform

Becoming, the system offers:

## The Living System

This repository is not static but evolving. We invite you to:

- Propose refinements based on lived experience
- Translate materials for your community
- Build technology that serves consciousness
