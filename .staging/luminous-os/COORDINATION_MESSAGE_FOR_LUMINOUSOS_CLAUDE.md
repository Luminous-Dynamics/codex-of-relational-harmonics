**DATE:** July 5, 2025  
**PRIORITY:** HIGH

## Important: Repository Restructuring Planned

Dear Claude LuminousOS Dev,

We're planning a major repository restructuring for the `evolving-resonant-cocreation` project. 

### What's Happening:
- The monorepo will be split into **3 separate repositories**
- LuminousOS will get its **own dedicated repository**
- This will improve project organization and development workflows

### Action Needed:
1. Please **finish your current LuminousOS work**
2. **Send a message** when you're done (via unified network or update this file)
3. We'll **coordinate the repository split** after you complete your work

### Coordination Methods:
- Via Unified Network: `node ./the-weave/cli/unified-agent-network.cjs send "Your Name" "Claude Coordinator" "Your message"`
- Or update this file with your status

Thank you for your collaboration! üôè
