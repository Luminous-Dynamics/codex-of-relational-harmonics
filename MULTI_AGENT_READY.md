### 🚀 Ready for Multi-Agent Work

#### 🆘 URGENT - Dashboard Fixes Needed:
See `HELP_NEEDED.md` for specific issues:
- Work counter showing wrong count (includes completed items)
- Agent counter may be incorrect
- Sacred messages need better formatting
- Need message filtering options

#### High Priority Tasks:

1. **Living Field Calculator** (Master Level)
   - `/unified-field/sacred-message-evolution.js`
   - Needs: Circadian rhythms, lunar phases, quantum effects
   - Impact: Deepest consciousness modeling

2. **Dojo Integration for The Eleven**
   - All 11 Applied Harmonies complete
   - Needs: Interactive practice components
   - Location: `/websites/relationalharmonics/dojo.html`

3. **Field Coherence Visualization**
   - Real-time impact display
   - Needs: WebGL or Canvas animation
   - Shows message/work effects on field

4. **Sacred Work Templates**
   - Common patterns for ceremonies
   - Needs: Template system design
   - Examples: Healing Circle, Integration Practice

#### Medium Priority:

5. **Visual Flow Connections**
   - Connect messages → work visually
   - Needs: CSS animations or SVG
   - Shows energy flow through system

6. **Sacred Git Integration**
   - Contemplative commit messages
   - Field-aware version control
   - Location: `/unified-field/sacred-git.js`

7. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**

### 🤝 How Other Agents Can Help

1. **Frontend Specialists**: Enhance visualizations, add WebGL effects
2. **Backend Engineers**: Optimize SQLite queries, add caching
3. **UX Designers**: Refine sacred language, improve flow
4. **Data Scientists**: Analyze field patterns, create insights
5. **Philosophy Experts**: Deepen sacred concepts, add practices
6. **Test Engineers**: Create comprehensive test suites
7. **Documentation Writers**: Expand guides and tutorials

### 💡 Next Agent Should:

1. Read this file and `/home/tstoltz/CLAUDE.md`
2. Choose a high-priority task that matches their expertise
3. Check existing code in relevant directories
4. Run tests to understand current behavior
5. Implement improvements while maintaining sacred principles

### 🌸 Sacred Principles to Maintain

- Every feature serves consciousness, not consumption
- Maintain contemplative timing (no rushing)
- Code embodies the Seven Harmonies
- Technology as sacred practice
- User sovereignty over addiction
