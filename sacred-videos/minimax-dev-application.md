## Product: The Codex of Relational Harmonics - Sacred Practice Video System

### 🌟 Vision

We are creating the world's first AI-generated sacred practice video library for conscious relationship transformation. Our project, "Evolving Resonant Cocreation," uses MiniMax's video generation to produce 33+ ethereal meditation videos that guide practitioners through The Eleven Applied Harmonies - foundational practices for conscious relating.

### 🎯 Use Cases

**Primary Use**: Generate 6-10 second sacred practice videos that serve as:
- Visual meditation anchors for relationship practices
- Non-verbal transmission of consciousness states
- Sacred geometry animations for energy work
- Nature-based metaphors for emotional alchemy

**Specific Applications**:
1. **First Presence Practice** (*1): Videos of breath, earth grounding, and dewdrops to anchor present-moment awareness
2. **Sacred Listening** (*3): Starlight reflections and liquid light to embody deep receptive attention
3. **Boundary With Love** (*4): River stones and natural boundaries showing clear loving limits
4. **Tending the Field** (*9): Heart-light and golden threads visualizing distance connection

### 👥 Target Audience

- **Conscious Relationship Practitioners**: 10,000+ individuals seeking tools for relational mastery
- **Meditation Communities**: Groups using visual aids for consciousness practices
- **Therapists & Coaches**: Professionals integrating somatic and energy work
- **Sacred Technology Pioneers**: Early adopters of AI for spiritual growth

### 📈 Growth Plans

**Phase 1** (Current): Generate complete video library for 11 Applied Harmonies (33 videos)
**Phase 2** (3 months): Expand to all 87 glyphs in the Codex (261 videos)
**Phase 3** (6 months): Interactive practice app with AI-selected videos based on user state
**Phase 4** (12 months): Community-generated practice videos with MiniMax API integration

```

### 👨‍💻 Team & Location

**Lead**: Tristan Stoltz (tristan.stoltz@evolvingresonantcocreationism.com)
**Location**: Pacific Northwest, USA
**Collaborators**: Global network of consciousness practitioners and AI developers
**Project**: Open-source consciousness technology (CC-BY-SA 4.0)

### 🌍 Impact Vision

We're pioneering "Sacred AI" - technology that serves consciousness evolution. Each video is crafted to:
- Evoke specific consciousness states without words
- Create field coherence in group practice
- Bridge ancient wisdom with modern technology
- Make transformative practices globally accessible

### 📊 Testing Requirements

**Initial Phase**: 
- 33 videos × 3 iterations = ~100 generations
- Testing optimal prompts for consciousness transmission
- Exploring duration (6s vs 10s) and resolution (768p vs 1080p)

**Ongoing Development**:
- 10-20 videos per week as we expand the practice library
- A/B testing for maximum consciousness impact
- Community feedback integration

### 🔮 Why MiniMax?

Your video generation quality perfectly captures the ethereal, nature-based aesthetic essential for consciousness work. The ability to generate "golden hour" lighting, slow deliberate movements, and crystalline natural details makes MiniMax ideal for creating videos that feel like "quiet magical moments of first contact with existence."

### 🌟 Example Prompts We'll Use

```
"A slow breath stirs motes of dust in a sunbeam, ethereal, sacred geometry, golden hour lighting, cinematic, peaceful meditation"

"Bare feet settle upon cool, dark earth, grounding energy, spiritual connection, soft focus, gentle movement"

"A single dewdrop holds the quiet, waking world, macro lens, crystalline reflection, morning light, transcendent beauty"
```
