# Terminology Reflection: "Sacred Guild" Reception Analysis
*Metacognitive assessment of language choices for developer outreach*

## ü§î **Potential Issues with "Sacred Guild"**

### **"Sacred" Concerns:**
- **Too spiritual/religious** for secular developers
- **Pretentious or grandiose** sounding  
- **Exclusionary** - implies others aren't "sacred"
- **Not serious enough** for professional tech context
- **Cultural barriers** - doesn't translate well globally

### **"Guild" Concerns:**
- **Medieval/archaic** - feels outdated
- **Exclusive club** connotations
- **Gatekeeping implications** - insider vs outsider
- **Overly formal** for modern collaborative development

### **Combined Impact:**
- **Spiritual gatekeeping** perception
- **Cult-like** associations
- **Alienates practical developers** who care about consciousness but not mystical language
- **Reduces applicant pool** unnecessarily
