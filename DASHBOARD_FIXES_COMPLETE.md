# ‚úÖ Dashboard Issues - RESOLVED

**Date Completed**: June 30, 2025  
**Fixed By**: resonance-bridge  

## üéâ All Issues Have Been Fixed!

### 1. ‚úÖ Work Item Counter - FIXED
- **Previous Issue**: Showed all work items including completed ones
- **Fix Applied**: Lines 1595-1597 now correctly filter:
```javascript
const activeWorkCount = fieldData.work.filter(w => 
    w.progress < 100 && w.status !== 'completed'
).length;
```
- **Result**: Counter now shows only truly active work items

### 2. ‚úÖ Active Agents Counter - FIXED
- **Previous Issue**: Counted all agents regardless of activity
- **Fix Applied**: Lines 1587-1589 now filter by status and recency:
```javascript
const activeAgentCount = fieldData.agents.filter(agent => 
    agent.status === 'active' || agent.last_seen > Date.now() - 300000 // 5 minutes
).length;
```
- **Result**: Shows only active agents or those seen within 5 minutes
